# Mock-Backend
A collection of tools to facilitate holding regular mocks with feedback and attendance within a university's debating society. 

## Current offerings:
-> assigner.py: Code that lets you take in debater preferences for mock timings and automatically allocates them. (Note: requires a handmade engagement score on the basis of which debaters are given preference)
-> adjes.py: Code that allows you to test, score and rank adjudicators.

## Future plan:
1. Allow data pipeline from google form to above-mentioned allocation
3. Create option for self-created timings and allocation from the side of the debaters
